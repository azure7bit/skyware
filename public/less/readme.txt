-- COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS -- 

To generate your CSS file from these LESS files. Download winLess from going to http://winless.org/ (for windows) and mac users can go to (http://incident57.com/less/) - they are both small apps/programs. 

Once installed load up and drop in the less folder to the 'Less Files' zone. Deselect all selected less files and only select "smartadmin-production.less" or "bootstrap.less" - depending on what custmizations you wanted to achieve. 

Hit compile and it should automatically create a minified CSS file to your css directory!

Having issues compiling? - Send me a message by logging on to wrapbootstrap.com



PS. You can also use prepros, download link: http://alphapixels.com/prepros/ - another alternative LESS compiler that really great with compression!
